Peijie Wu (吴佩洁) is a Ph.D. candidate major in Transportation Planning and Management at Harbin Institute of Technology in China. Currently, I focus on analyzing the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of high-risk spots in urban roads and exploring the transportation big data with advanced statistical methods and emerging machine learning algorithms. Besides, my researches also include a wide range of transportation, such as public transportation, human factors, and intergated transportation planning. Overall, I interest in emerging technologies that will enhance safety performance of the traffic system.<br>
