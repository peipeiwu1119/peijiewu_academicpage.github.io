excerpt: 'The problem of urban crashes brings huge challenges andthreats to local police and governments, especially in manycities in developing countries such as China. To reduce thefrequency and severity of urban crashes, the local governmentin China has gradually taken interest in conducting detailedactions of traffic safety improvement at the microzone-level.Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to try a newmethod in spatiotemporal data mining techniques, the space-time cube method, to find high-risk crash spots at the spatio-temporal level and to obtain their spatiotemporal evolutionpatterns. The cumulative frequency curve method was per-formed to identify high-risk crash spots, and the contributoryfactors of forming these spots were analyzed by the latentclass analysis method. The results showed that: (1) key param-etersâ€™selection is crucial in the space-time cube construction;(2) the exit ramp gore point in interchanges, intersections,and entrances of neighborhoods were prone to have manyhigh-risk crash spots at the spatiotemporal scale; and (3) loca-tions with consecutive, persistent, and sporadic hotspots pat-terns need different risk monitoring strategies and trafficsafety improvement. The feasibility and advantages of thespace-time cube method in hotspots identification at themicrozone-level were confirmed. '
