I traveled to Yellowstone in June 2021 and stay there for about 4 days. For natural sites, Yellowstone is the best national park in the U.S. as in my own opinion. The travel to Yellowstone gives me a deep impression. The Springs here are beautiful and unique. As to me, this is the most beautiful Spring in Yellowstone. Here is the picture for the Grand Prismatic Spring, its color is like a rainbow. It is also highly recommended to take an Overlook of this Spring in the mountain (recommend to drive to the next parking lot ahead and walk to the platform of the mountain, and it will take about 30 minutes, a little bit time consuming but really deserve to have a look of that)

 We encountered some American bison walking in green grassland and roadways, also for some deers and a cute beer.

 For the whole travel, we first flew from Charlotte to Bozeman, then we drive to the West Yellowstone Village. After that, we went toward the south and stayed in Salt Lake City for one night. Then we stayed in Page village and visit the Horseshoe Bend, Grand Canyon, and Arches National Park. 
 We drove to the Grand Canyon and ended our travel to Las Vegas. We also travel to the Hoover Dam and the Death Vally. The scenery in Grand Canyon is also very amazing and deserves to have a look.
